	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src="Picture.jpg" alt="Profile picture">
	<p>My name is Benjamin and I am 23 years old. I was born and raised in Utah, and currently live in still Utah.</p>
	<p>I am passionate about computer hardware, architecture, and the silicon fabrication technology, and enjoy learning about that for no reason other than I want to. In my free time, you can often find me at home, contimplating the implications of silicon disaggregation and 3D stacking in the coming years.</p>
	<p>I graduated from Fremont High School and was nominated to be the Sterling Scholar in computer technology in my graduating class of 1,000. I currently work as a Quality Review Tax Examing Technician for the Amended personal tax returns department at the IRS.</p>
	<p>I have done basic programming in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, C#, C++, and very high level Python.</p>
