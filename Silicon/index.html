      <h1>What are Chiplets?</h1>
      <p> First, we need to talk about what a <span class="italicized-text">normal</span> chip or dies are. The most common chips, in most consumer devices, are called monolithic or a single piece of silicon. When a chip is broken into separate parts, there are multiple levels of disaggregation. The most common version is called chiplets, but there is a more "basic" version called MCM or Multiple Chip Module. </p>
      <p> MCM is generally accepted as having multiple of the same dies interconnected to act as a single processor. This picture below shows a server CPU in both a hypothetical, large monolithic die compared to four of the same dies interconnected to each other. </p>

      <p> 
        Chiplets are individual functional units or components of an integrated circuit (IC) that are designed and fabricated separately and then interconnected to form a larger system. Instead of building a single monolithic IC containing all the required functions, chiplets allow for modular and flexible integration of different components. </p>
      <p> How I view the difference between MCM and chiplets is based on how AMD explains it. The simplified version is that MCM is when multiple of the same die are interconnected but isn't dependent on having multiple chips. Chiplets are similar to MCM, but they use multiple different dies and generally rely on having one of each kind. For examples, <a href="products.html" class="italicized-text">click here</a>. Below is a picture of the evolution of AMD's server processors. </p>

    <section id="chiplet-explanation">
      <h2>Why do we use Chiplets?</h2>
      <p> 
        Each chiplet is typically designed to perform a specific function, such as a processor core, memory controller, input/output interface, or specialized accelerator. 
        They are fabricated on separate dies using different semiconductor process technologies optimized for their specific functions. This modular approach allows for more 
        efficient development and manufacturing as well as better customization and scalability. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Chiplets are interconnected using advanced packaging technologies, such as silicon interposers or through-silicon vias 
        <a href="definitions.html#TSVs" class="italicized-text">(TSVs)</a>, which provide the electrical and mechanical connections between the different chiplets. 
        These interconnects enable high-speed data transfer and communication between the chiplets, forming a cohesive system.

          The bigger the die size, but more likely there will be an error that requires the die to be sold for cheaper and have a few parts disabled.
