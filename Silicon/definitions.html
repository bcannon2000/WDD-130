      <h4>Semiconductor Dies:</h4>
      <p> The individual chips or dies that perform specific functions, such as processors, memory, or specialized components. </p>

      <h4 id="TSVs">Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs):</h4>
      <p> Through-silicon vias are vertical electrical connections that pass through the silicon substrate of a semiconductor device. They enable communication and electrical connections between different layers or components within a chip or a 3D package. They are made with a pillar of copper that passes either from the bottom to top when used for active power passthrough or can start within the die when stacking passive die. </p>

      <h4 id="interposer">Interposer:</h4>
      <p> A silicon-based substrate that serves as a bridge between the semiconductor dies. It provides a platform for mounting and connecting the dies and contains the necessary interconnect structures, such as through-silicon vias (TSVs) or microbumps, to establish electrical connections between the dies and the interposer. </p>

      <h4 id="Substrate">Substrate:</h4>
      <p> The substrate provides a foundation for the interposer and helps to mechanically support and protect the 2.5D package. It also facilitates the electrical connections between the interposer and the external system or PCB. </p>
