      <h4>Semiconductor Dies:</h4>
      <p>
        A semiconductor die also called a chip, is a small piece of semiconductor material, typically made of silicon, on which electronic components and circuits are fabricated. 
        It is the foundation of an integrated circuit (IC) or microchip.
      </p>
      <p>
        The die is usually a small, square, or rectangular piece of silicon, with dimensions typically measured in millimeters. It is often encapsulated in protective packaging 
        material, such as plastic or ceramic, to provide mechanical support, protection from external elements, and electrical connections through bond wires or solder bumps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Semiconductor dies are fundamental building blocks in modern electronics, serving as the core components in a wide range of devices, including microprocessors, memory chips, 
        sensors, and various integrated circuits. They are manufactured through intricate semiconductor fabrication processes, allowing for the production of complex electronic 
        systems on a small scale.

      <h4 id="TSVs">Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs):</h4>
      <p>
        Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) are small pathways that go through the silicon substrate of a semiconductor device, allowing for vertical connections between different layers or 
        components. These pathways consist of metal-filled holes that run through the silicon wafer. TSVs create direct electrical pathways for signals, power, and data transfer 
        between different levels of a device or between stacked chips in 3D packaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        They bring several advantages to semiconductor device design and packaging. They enhance performance by enabling high-speed communication between different layers or components,
         reducing delays and improving overall device performance. Additionally, TSVs optimize space usage within a device by allowing for higher component density and more efficient 
         utilization of the available area.
      </p>
      <p>
        This contribute to an increase of power efficiency by facilitating effective power delivery throughout the device, reducing power consumption, and enhancing power management capabilities. 
        They also offer design flexibility, combining different components with varied functionalities or manufacturing processes in a single package, enabling customization and 
        adaptability.
      </p>
      <p>
        TSVs can also improve thermal management by providing pathways for heat dissipation. This allows heat to pass through metal rather than through the silicon. This helps prevent 
        overheating and ensures the device operates within safe temperature limits. TSVs are crucial components in advanced semiconductor packaging. They enable vertical interconnections,
         improving performance, space utilization, power efficiency, design flexibility, and thermal management in modern semiconductor devices.

      <h4>Interposer:</h4>
      <p> 
        A silicon-based substrate that serves as a bridge between the semiconductor dies. It provides a platform for mounting and connecting the dies and contains the necessary 
        interconnect structures, such as through-silicon vias (TSVs) or micro bumps, to establish electrical connections between the die and the interposer. 
      </p>

      <h4>Substrate:</h4>
      <p> 
        The substrate provides a foundation for the interposer and helps to support and protect the 2.5D package mechanically. It also facilitates the electrical connections 
        between the interposer and the external system or PCB.
