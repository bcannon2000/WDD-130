			<h3>
				Color Palette
			</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

			<h3>
				Typography
			</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h3>
				Normal paragraph example
			</h3>
			<p>
				As we broaden the use of our technologies, across packaging, software, internal and external, we're confident that we can deliver a leadership product family in the marketplace across all of our major product categories,” he
				said. “I was also very pleased to see some of the long-term innovations coming out of [Intel's Technology Development team] as we work to close any gaps with external foundries as well as leap ahead. And clearly, we're not
				interested in just closing gaps. We're interested in resuming that position of the unquestioned leader in process technology, and that's our commitment.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Colored paragraph example
			</h3>
			<p class="colored">
				Intel has gone through cycles before. We've had periods where we were ahead and periods where we were behind. Others, personally I was very involved in, periods where we were very diminished in the marketplace and late to
				the multi-core [CPU].

			<h3>Chiplets (Home)</h3>
			Chiplets are smaller, independent units that perform specific functions within electronic devices. Unlike traditional chips that integrate all components into one, chiplets modularize the design and manufacturing process. They
			allow for customization, faster development cycles, and improved performance and efficiency. Chiplets can make our computers more powerful, energy-efficient, and flexibile, contributing to better user experiences and cost
			optimization
			<p>Possible topics</p>
			<p>AMD's chiplets or Intel's tiles or MCM</p>
			<p>Pros: Scalability, Flexibilily, Reusibility, Modularity, Yields per wafer, lower cost</p>
			<p>Cons: Fixed costs, Development Costs, Design Complexity, Interconnect Challenges</p>
			<p>Images for Chiplets</p>

			<h3>Advanced Packaging</h3>
			<p>
				Advanced packaging refers to innovative techniques and approaches used in the packaging of semiconductor chips. It involves the integration of multiple components, such as processors, memory, sensors, and other
				functionalities, into a compact and efficient package.
			</p>
			<p>Possible topics</p>
			<p>AMD CPUs, GPUs, APUs/Intel's CPUs, Datacenter GPUs, types of interconnects</p>
			<p>Pros: Miniaturization, Performance Improvement, Higher Integration Density, Cost Optimization</p>
			<p>Cons: Increased Development Costs, Design Complexity, Interconnect Challenges, Testing and Reliability</p>
