      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Silicon disaggregation, also known as chiplets, refers to the process of breaking down a complex system-on-chip (SoC) into smaller individual chips or chiplets
         that can be independently designed, manufactured, and interconnected. This approach enables greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness in semiconductor 
         design, allowing for easier integration of specialized components and faster time-to-market. Advanced packaging techniques, such as 2.5D and 3D integration, complement 
         silicon disaggregation by enabling efficient interconnection and stacking of chiplets, enhancing performance, power efficiency, and reducing form factor in high-performance 
         computing and mobile devices.</p>

        As we broaden the use of our technologies, across packaging, software, internal and external, we're confident that we can deliver a leadership product family 
        in the marketplace across all of our major product categories,” he said. “I was also very pleased to see some of the long-term innovations coming out of 
        [Intel's Technology Development team] as we work to close any gaps with external foundries as well as leap ahead. And clearly, we're not interested in just 
        closing gaps. We're interested in resuming that position of the unquestioned leader in process technology, and that's our commitment.

      <p class="colored">
        Intel has gone through cycles before. We've had periods where we were ahead and periods where we were behind. Others, personally I was very involved in,
         periods where we were very diminished in the marketplace and late to the multi-core [CPU].
