      <h1>Evolution of AMD chiplet products</h1>
      <h3>What is AMD Zen?</h3>
      
        <p>
          The importance of AMD's Zen microarchitecture lies in its significant impact on the semiconductor industry and AMD's competitiveness.
          It brought competitive performance, improved power efficiency, and scalability to AMD processors, challenging Intel's dominance and 
          disrupting the CPU market. Zen revitalized AMD's position, expanded its product lineup, and drove innovation and choice for consumers 
          and businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Zen brought the era of chiplets with the modularity, integration, manufacturing efficiency, performance optimization, and 
          scalability to their processors, allowing AMD to deliver competitive products and adapt to evolving market needs effectively. This 
          allowed for the nearly bankrupt company to make a single die that worked for every product line up including but no limited to: desktops, workstations, 
          and servers. This one "MCM" die allowed them to make products stack that went against Intel's 8 diffrent dies.
