              <h4>Semiconductor dies:</h4>
                <p>The individual chips or dies that perform specific functions, such as processors, memory, or specialized components.</p>

              <h4>Interposer:</h4>
                <p>A silicon-based substrate that serves as a bridge between the semiconductor dies. It provides a platform for mounting 
                  and connecting the dies and contains the necessary interconnect structures, such as through-silicon vias (TSVs) or microbumps, 
                  to establish electrical connections between the dies and the interposer.</p>

              <h4>Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs):</h4>
                <p>TSVs are vertical electrical interconnects that pass through the thickness of the interposer. They provide a direct pathway for signals 
                  to pass between the different layers of the 2.5D package, enabling high-bandwidth communication and reducing signal propagation delays.</p>

              <h4>Substrate:</h4>
                <p>The substrate provides a foundation for the interposer and helps to mechanically support and protect the 2.5D package. It 
                  also facilitates the electrical connections between the interposer and the external system or PCB.</p>
