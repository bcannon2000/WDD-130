    <h1>Types of Packaging</h1>
    <p>
      There are many different types of "Advanced Packaging," but I will focus on the most advanced versions, 2.5D and 3D stacking.

      <h2>2.5D Packaging</h2>
      <p>
        2.5D packaging, or 2.5D interposer packaging, is an advanced packaging technique that integrates multiple chiplets onto a shared interposer substrate.
        Chiplets are individual functional units or components of an integrated circuit (IC) designed and fabricated separately. 2.5D packaging provides a means 
        to bring these chiplets together compactly and highly efficiently.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        The picture above shows a substrate with an interposer that has chiplets stacked on top. The 2.5 TSVs pass data and power to/from the chips or memory chips  
        on top of the interposer. The interposer is made using the same technology that our processors used in 2005, called 65/55nm. The interposer allows for precise wire 
        routing and enables the chiplets and memory to communicate directly with each other extremely fast. 
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        These are the primary 2.5D packaging technique. Multi-Chip Packaging, or MCP, is the most basic packaging, called 2D. The silicon interposer is the more straightforward to implement. The last version skips the interposer entirely and embeds a silicon bridge directly connecting the dies without interference. 
        Intel calls its silicon bridge tech EMIB or embedded multi-die interconnect bridge, and TSMC calls theirs InFO-LSI or Integrated Fanouts(InfO) Local Silicon Interconnect (LSI).

      <h2>3D Packaging</h2>
      <p>
        3D stacking, also known as 3D packaging or vertical integration, is an advanced semiconductor packaging technique that involves vertically stacking multiple dies or 
        chips on top of each other. This vertical arrangement increases component density, performance, and form factor optimization. Through-silicon vias (TSVs)
        establish electrical connections between the stacked components, enabling high-bandwidth communication and synchronization. This technique facilitates the integration of 
        dies or chips with different functionalities, process technologies, or manufacturers, known as heterogeneous integration, to optimize system performance and functionality.
         3D stacking offers performance, power efficiency, and form factor optimization advantages, making it a powerful packaging approach for compact 
        and highly integrated semiconductor devices.

      <p>
        The picture depicts a cross-section of a semiconductor package demonstrating two stacking technologies: hybrid bonding and solder bumps. The package consists of multiple 
        chiplets vertically stacked on each other, representing a 3D integration configuration. In the right portion of the image, the hybrid bonding, or copper-to-copper bonding
        technique, is illustrated. It showcases two semiconductor wafers bonded together using the hybrid bonding process. The wafers are aligned and brought into close contact,
        creating a direct and intimate atomic or molecular connection at the bonding interface. This hybrid bonding allows efficient electrical connections between the stacked
        wafers, enabling high-speed data transfer and interconnectivity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The solder bump technology is depicted on the left portion of the image. It highlights using small solder bumps or balls between the chips and the substrate or 
        interposer. The solder bumps are shown as spherical structures connecting the bonding pads of the chips to the corresponding places on the substrate. The solder bumps 
        undergo a phase change through heat, forming metallurgical bonds as they solidify. Technology provides reliable electrical connections between the stacked components,
        facilitating efficient signal transmission and power distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, the picture showcases both hybrid bonding and solder bumps as key stacking technologies in semiconductor packaging. These techniques enable the integration of 
        multiple chips or chiplets compactly and efficiently, enhancing performance, power efficiency, and form factor optimization in advanced semiconductor devices.

        Above is one of the first major consumer products with 3D stacking implemented. They named this specific implication of hybrid bonding AMD 3D V-cache. This came out to 
        consumers and data center products in 2022 and tripled the on-chip memory, or cache, from 32MB to 96MB without any significant downsides other than voltage, thermal, and power 
        limitations.
