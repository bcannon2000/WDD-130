    <h1>Types of Packaging</h1>
    <p>
      There are quite a few diffrent types of "Advanced Packaging," but I will be focusing on the most advanced versions, 2.5D and 3D stacking.

      <h2>2.5D Packaging</h2>
      <p>
        2.5D packaging, also known as 2.5D interposer packaging, is an advanced packaging technique used to integrate multiple chiplets onto a shared interposer substrate.
        Chiplets are individual functional units or components of an integrated circuit (IC) that are designed and fabricated separately. 2.5D packaging provides a means 
        to bring these chiplets together in a compact and highly efficient manner.

      </div>
      <p>
        The picture above shows an substrate with an interposer that has chiplets stacked on top. The 2.5 TSVs passes data and power to/from the chips or memory chips that are 
        on top the interposter The interposer is made using the same technology that our processors used in 2005, called 65/55nm. The interposer interposer allows for precise wires 
        routing to be made and allow for the chiplets and memory to directly communicate between each other extremely fast.

      <p>
        These are the main 2.5D packaging technique. Multi-Chip Packaging, or MCP, is the most basic packaging simple called, 2D. The silicon interposer is the simpler and
        easier to impliment. The last version skips the interposer entirely and embeds a silicon bridge that directly connects the dies together with no other interference. 
        Intel calls their silicon bridge tech EMIB or embedded multi-die interconnect bridge, TSMC calls thiers InFO-LSI or Integrated Fanouts(InfO) Local Silicon Interconnect (LSI).

      <h2>3D Packaging</h2>
      <p>
        3D stacking, also known as 3D packaging or vertical integration, is an advanced semiconductor packaging technique that involves vertically stacking multiple dies or 
        chips on top of each other. This vertical arrangement allows for increased component density, improved performance, and form factor optimization. Through-silicon vias 
        (TSVs) are used to establish electrical connections between the stacked components, enabling high-bandwidth communication and synchronization. This technique facilitates 
        the integration of dies or chips with different functionalities, process technologies, or manufacturers, known as heterogeneous integration, to optimize system performance 
        and functionality. 3D stacking offers advantages in terms of performance, power efficiency, and form factor optimization, making it a powerful packaging approach for compact 
        and highly integrated semiconductor devices.

      <p>
        The picture depicts a cross-section of a semiconductor package demonstrating two stacking technologies: hybrid bonding and solder bumps. The package consists of multiple 
        chiplets vertically stacked on top of each other, representing a 3D integration configuration. In the right portion of the image, the hybrid bonding, or copper to copper bonding
        technique is illustrated. It showcases two semiconductor wafers bonded together using the hybrid bonding process. The wafers are aligned and brought into close contact,
        creating a direct and intimate atomic or molecular connection at the bonding interface. This hybrid bonding allows for efficient electrical connections between the stacked
        wafers, enabling high-speed data transfer and interconnectivity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the left portion of the image, the solder bump technology is depicted. It highlights the use of small solder bumps or solder balls between the chips and the substrate or 
        interposer. The solder bumps are shown as spherical structures connecting the bonding pads of the chips to the corresponding pads on the substrate. Through the application of 
        heat, the solder bumps undergo a phase change, forming metallurgical bonds as they solidify. Technology provides reliable electrical connections between the stacked components,
        facilitating efficient signal transmission and power distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, the picture showcases both hybrid bonding and solder bumps as key stacking technologies in semiconductor packaging. These techniques enable the integration of 
        multiple chips or chiplets in a compact and efficient manner, enhancing performance, power efficiency, and form factor optimization in advanced semiconductor devices.

      <p>
        Above is one of the first major consumer products that had 3D stacking inplimented. They named this specific implimation of hybrid bonding, AMD 3D V-cache. This came out to 
        consumers and data center products in 2022 and tripled the on chip memory, or cache, from 32MB to 96MB without any major downsides other than voltage, thermal, and power limitations.
